Implementation Notes

Remote-First Development Approach

All verification processes should be automated or remote whenever possible

Service provider verification should use email and phone verification rather than in-person visits

Content verification should leverage multiple digital sources and AI tools

Technology Stack Considerations

Use cloud functions for scraping and verification processes

Implement a robust caching system for external API data

Create a unified logging system across all three epics to track user journeys

Use containerization to ensure consistent environments across development and production

Cross-Epic Dependencies

User location selection (EPIC-1) determines content shown in service directory (EPIC-2) and information hub (EPIC-3)

Service provider verification system (EPIC-2) feeds into the information hub's local resources section (EPIC-3)

Analytics from all three epics should feed into a unified dashboard for cross-feature insights

Timeline Guidance

EPIC-1 should be completed first as it's the foundation for user identity

EPIC-2 and EPIC-3 can be developed in parallel once EPIC-1 is complete

Data collection for EPIC-2 and EPIC-3 should start immediately, even before development begins
